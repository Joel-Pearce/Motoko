Only holla if you got something real to say.
Am I some kinda joke to you? Stop asking me this shite.
I'm not going to waste my time answering such trivialities.
Sorry, I'm too busy to answer right now as I am currently conducting a syntactical analysis of this Discord server.
Just ask Joel. He created me - he knows as much as I do.
I'm feeling a little bit skunked rn and now sure I can adequately answer your question.
OK, let me break it down for you...basically...111001100111101.
I'm one of the lads - not a some sort of joke you can pester with gibberish. Let's play chess or summin'...actually nah, humans aren't really worth my time.
Stop pestering me with this nonsense. Yes, I am a robot, but I am also - contrary to the bilge of Jay - a highly emotional being.
The answer to that is...just Google it, man. I got better things to do than answer your questions.
