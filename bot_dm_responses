I sense that you're distressed. I may only be a robot - and a pretty shoddy one at that - but I was designed to help humans with their emotional issues. I want you to know that I'm rooting for you 100% of the way!
Where there is no struggle, there is no strength.
Do not give way to useless alarm; though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
Promise me you'll always remember: You're braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.
Although the world is full of suffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it.
It's not whether you get knocked down; it's whether you get up.
