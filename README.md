A bot created for a Discord server I created for my friends over lockdown.

The bot will parse messages sent on the server and respond accordingly. If the message contains an emotionally negative word, the bot will private message the 
sender with a motivational quote. The bot also keeps a chatlog of all messages sent on the server, and sends these to a CSV file with the help of Pandas.
